# solar-system

Sample app written in Three.js showing a simplified view of our Solar System.

By simplified I mean the following:

* shows only the terrestrial planets
* assumes all orbits are circular
* all physical values are rounded (orbit periods, offsets, distances from the Sun, etc)

# Model of celestial bodies

This project uses a recursive model to represent celestial bodies. A `CelestialBody` object can have an array of other `CelestialBody` objects as its satellites.

In the application you can see how it was implemented with Sun -> Earth -> Moon.
